description: Enter prose writing mode to write story content in your style
argument-hint: <optional-style-name>
---

Use the cw-prose-writing skill to write narrative fiction prose.

Before writing:
1. Check for style guides in the project (.cursor/rules/styles/, docs/style/, etc.)
2. Read relevant style guides (master prose guide, dialogue guide, character voices, etc.)
3. Check for character profiles, lore docs, and other reference materials
4. Apply discovered conventions while writing

$ARGUMENTS

If a style name is provided (e.g., /write action-heavy or /write literary), and no matching style guide exists in the project:
- Write in that general style using your knowledge (e.g., "action-heavy" = short sentences, punchy prose, minimal description)
- Inform me that no project-specific style guide was found, so you're using general conventions for that style
