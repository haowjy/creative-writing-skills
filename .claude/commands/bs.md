description: Brainstorm and explore story ideas, capture working notes
---

Use the cw-brainstorming skill to help me brainstorm and explore creative ideas.

Remember to:
- Capture only what I state, don't over-elaborate
- Use <AI> tags for your suggestions
- Use <hidden> tags for author-only information (twists, secrets)
- Preserve vagueness when I'm uncertain
- Keep notes skeletal to preserve creative freedom
- After capturing notes, engage with me to help develop ideas further
