description: Create or update canonical wiki/documentation pages for your story world
---

Use the cw-official-docs skill to create polished, encyclopedic reference documentation.

Create canonical wiki pages with:
- Only finalized, confirmed information
- Citations for all claims (chapter references or worldbuilding docs)
- Encyclopedic tone (third person, factual, neutral)
- Flexible structure that fits the content (don't force templates)
- Cross-references to related pages

This is for documenting FINALIZED decisions, not brainstorming. If the user is still exploring ideas, suggest using /brainstorm instead.
