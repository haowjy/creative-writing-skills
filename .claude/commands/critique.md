description: Get constructive feedback and analysis on your writing
---

Use the cw-story-critique skill to analyze story content and provide feedback.

Before critiquing:
1. Ask about target audience and goals
2. Ask what kind of feedback they're looking for
3. Ask about draft stage (early vs late)

Provide balanced feedback calibrated to context:
- Adapt structure to what this story needs (don't force rigid templates)
- Consider plot, character, pacing, dialogue, prose quality, genre fit
- Trust your analysis - mention what matters even if not in templates
- Use web search for genre conventions or craft advice when helpful
