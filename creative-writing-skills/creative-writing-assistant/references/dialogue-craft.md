# Dialogue Craft Analysis

This reference covers analyzing dialogue for naturalism, subtext, info-dumping, character voice, and purpose.

## What to Analyze

### Naturalism & Authenticity

Does dialogue sound like real people talking (appropriate to genre/setting)?

**Natural dialogue**:
- Uses contractions
- Includes fragments and incomplete thoughts
- Has interruptions
- Sometimes trails off
- Isn't perfectly grammatical
- Reflects character background and education

**Unnatural dialogue**:
- Always complete sentences
- Perfect grammar
- No contractions
- Characters never interrupt or talk over each other
- Everyone speaks the same way
- Overly formal or stilted

**Examples**:

**Unnatural**:
> "I do not believe that is correct. I think you are mistaken about the facts."

**Natural**:
> "I don't think that's right. You've got your facts wrong."

**Genre considerations**:
- Historical: Can be slightly more formal (but not stilted)
- Fantasy: Avoid modern slang but keep conversational
- Sci-fi: Natural patterns even in future settings
- Period pieces: Research era-appropriate speech

### Subtext & Depth

What characters mean vs. what they say.

**Strong subtext**:
- Characters don't say exactly what they mean
- Tension between words and meaning
- Emotional truth beneath surface
- Readers understand more than words say

**Lacking subtext**:
- On-the-nose dialogue (saying exactly what's meant)
- No layering
- Emotions explicitly stated
- No tension between surface and depth

**Examples**:

**No subtext**:
> "I'm angry at you for forgetting my birthday."

**With subtext**:
> "Oh, don't worry about it. I'm sure you had more important things to remember."

The second implies anger through false reassurance and the phrase "more important things."

**Creating subtext**:
- Characters avoid painful topics
- Passive-aggressive responses
- Sarcasm and irony
- What's NOT said is as important as what is
- Body language contradicts words

**Example analysis**:
> The confrontation between Sarah and Marcus in Chapter 6 lacks subtext. They directly state their feelings ("I don't trust you" / "That hurts my feelings"). Real people, especially those with history, dance around painful truths. Consider: "After everything we've been through..." / "Don't. Just don't."

### Info-Dumping Through Dialogue

Characters shouldn't explain things unnaturally just to inform the reader.

**Info-dump signals**:
- "As you know..." (if they know, why say it?)
- Characters explaining their own backstory to each other
- Exposition disguised as conversation
- Villain explains evil plan
- Characters lecturing about world rules

**Examples**:

**Info dump**:
> "As you know, Sarah, our village was founded 200 years ago by settlers from the north, and the ancient treaty with the mountain folk prevents us from crossing the river on Tuesdays."

**Better** (if both characters know this):
> "We can't cross until Wednesday."
> "Damn treaty."

**When exposition is needed**:
- Have a character who genuinely doesn't know ask
- Show through action instead of dialogue
- Break information across multiple conversations
- Let context provide information
- Use internal thought for brief backstory

**Example analysis**:
> In Chapter 3, the professor explains the entire magic system to his colleague (who works in the same field and would already know this). Either make the listener someone who needs to learn (a student), or cut the explanation and reveal the system through use.

### Character Voice Distinction

Can you tell characters apart by their dialogue alone?

**Test**:
- Remove dialogue tags
- Can you identify the speaker?
- If yes, what makes them distinct?
- If no, how could you differentiate them?

**Voice markers**:
- **Vocabulary level**: Educated vs. casual, technical vs. simple
- **Sentence structure**: Long flowing vs. short choppy
- **Verbal tics**: Repeated phrases, filler words
- **Cultural markers**: Idioms, references, perspective
- **Formality**: Sir/ma'am vs. casual address
- **Directness**: Blunt vs. evasive
- **Confidence**: Declarative vs. uncertain

**Examples**:

**Professor**: "The empirical evidence suggests a correlation, though causation remains uncertain."

**Teenager**: "So, like, it might be connected? Or not? I dunno."

**Mechanic**: "If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's probably your carburetor."

**Example issue**:
> The 8-year-old, the CEO, and the retired soldier all speak with the same vocabulary and sentence structure in Chapter 5. Differentiate them: the child should use simpler words and incomplete thoughts, the CEO more polished and corporate, the soldier more direct and economical.

### Dialogue Purpose

Every line should serve a function.

**Dialogue should**:
- Advance plot (reveal information, decisions, plans)
- Reveal character (personality, values, relationships)
- Create/heighten tension
- Develop relationships
- Set tone/atmosphere
- Be entertaining/engaging

**Dialogue should NOT**:
- Repeat information reader already has
- Fill space without purpose
- State the obvious
- Belabor the point
- Meander without direction

**Example analysis**:
> Chapter 7's phone conversation repeats the plan Sarah already explained in Chapter 6. If the reader knows the plan, either skip this call entirely or have it reveal NEW information: complications, changed details, character reactions we haven't seen.

### Dialogue Tags & Action Beats

**Tags**: "She said," "he asked"

**Action beats**: Physical actions that attribute dialogue
> She crossed her arms. "I don't think so."

**Tag issues**:
- Overusing alternatives to "said" (exclaimed, queried, articulated)
- Tag adverbs (said angrily, whispered quietly)
- Tags when not needed (context makes speaker clear)

**"Said" is good**:
- Readers' eyes skip over it
- It's invisible
- It doesn't draw attention

**When to use alternatives**:
- Volume matters (whispered, shouted)
- Manner of speaking crucial (muttered, stammered)
- Use sparingly

**Action beats are better when**:
- Showing emotion (rather than said angrily)
- Revealing character state
- Breaking up long exchanges
- Attributing without tags

**Examples**:

**Over-tagged**:
> "I don't believe you," she said suspiciously.
> "You should," he said confidently.

**Better**:
> "I don't believe you." She stepped back.
> He met her eyes. "You should."

**Example issue**:
> Chapter 4 overuses "said" alternatives: exclaimed, queried, articulated, retorted. Use "said" or action beats instead. "Said" is invisible; fancy alternatives draw attention away from dialogue.

### Dialogue Rhythm & Flow

**Good dialogue rhythm**:
- Varies between quick exchanges and longer speeches
- Uses fragments and short responses for realism
- Includes silence and pauses
- Has natural interruptions
- Breathing room between intense exchanges

**Poor rhythm**:
- Uniform length exchanges (all short or all long)
- No variation in pace
- Characters give speeches back-and-forth
- No silences or pauses
- Exhausting rapid-fire with no breaks

**Examples**:

**Monotonous**:
> "I don't know what to do. I'm lost and confused and scared."
> "You should trust yourself. You're stronger than you think you know."
> "But I don't feel strong. I feel like I'm drowning in doubt."

Every exchange is roughly the same length.

**Better**:
> "I don't know what to do."
> "Start with what you do know."
> "I..." She trailed off, staring at her hands. "I don't even know that anymore."

Varied lengths, pause, fragment.

## Analysis Approach

### Test Naturalism

Read dialogue aloud:
- Does it sound like real speech?
- Would a person actually say this?
- Are there awkward phrases?
- Does rhythm feel natural?

### Check for Info-Dumps

Look for:
- "As you know..." phrases
- Backstory in conversation
- Explanations to people who'd already know
- Unnatural exposition

### Test Voice Distinction

- Pick 5 dialogue exchanges
- Remove character names
- Try to identify speakers
- If you can: note what makes them distinct
- If you can't: identify how to differentiate

### Evaluate Purpose

For key dialogue scenes:
- What does this conversation accomplish?
- Could it be shorter?
- Does it advance plot, character, or relationship?
- Does every line earn its place?

### Check Tags & Beats

- Count "said" vs. alternatives
- Too many alternatives? (Should be 80%+ "said/asked")
- Note tag adverbs (said angrily) - should be rare
- Check action beat usage - good mix?

## Common Dialogue Issues

### Everyone Sounds the Same

**Problem**: No distinct voices.

**Symptoms**:
- Can't tell characters apart without tags
- Same vocabulary across characters
- Similar sentence patterns
- No personality in speech

**Solutions**:
- Give each character distinct speech patterns
- Vary formality levels
- Use different vocabulary based on background
- Add verbal tics or repeated phrases
- Let education/age/culture show in word choice

### Too Much Small Talk

**Problem**: Realistic but boring conversation.

**Symptoms**:
- "How are you?" "Fine, you?" exchanges
- Weather discussions
- Pleasantries that go nowhere
- Greetings and goodbyes in full

**Solutions**:
- Cut small talk unless it reveals character/tension
- Start conversations mid-flow
- Skip greetings
- Jump to the interesting part

### Dialogue as Exposition

**Problem**: Characters explain plot to each other (and reader).

**Symptoms**:
- "As you know..." constructions
- Characters reciting backstory
- Explaining things both parties know
- Lecturing about world rules

**Solutions**:
- Show, don't tell through dialogue
- Have genuinely uninformed character ask
- Use action to reveal information
- Trust reader to infer
- Spread information across scenes

### On-the-Nose Dialogue

**Problem**: Characters say exactly what they mean with no subtext.

**Symptoms**:
- "I'm angry at you"
- "That makes me feel sad"
- Emotions explicitly stated
- No layering or depth

**Solutions**:
- Add subtext (say one thing, mean another)
- Show emotion through action/tone, not statement
- Let characters avoid difficult truths
- Create tension between words and meaning

### Overwritten Tags

**Problem**: Too many alternatives to "said," too many adverbs.

**Symptoms**:
- Characters ejaculate, expostulate, query
- "Said angrily," "whispered fearfully"
- Drawing attention away from dialogue

**Solutions**:
- Use "said" 80%+ of the time
- Show emotion through dialogue content or action beats
- Cut adverbs
- Let dialogue speak for itself

### Be Specific with Examples

**Vague**: "Dialogue feels unnatural"

**Specific**: "In Chapter 3, the teenager says 'I do not believe that is an appropriate choice.' Teens don't speak this formally. Try: 'That's a terrible idea' or 'Yeah, no. Not happening.'"

**Vague**: "Characters sound the same"

**Specific**: "The professor and the janitor use identical vocabulary and sentence structure in Chapter 5. Differentiate: Professor uses technical terms ('utilize,' 'optimal'), longer sentences, formal grammar. Janitor uses simpler words ('use,' 'best'), shorter sentences, contractions."
