## Usage Notes

When filling out this template:

1. **Be specific**: Replace all bracketed placeholders with actual observations
2. **Quantify**: Use numbers, percentages, frequencies
3. **Show examples**: Include actual quotes from the samples
4. **Note absences**: What's NOT present is as important as what is
5. **Acknowledge limitations**: If samples are small, say so
6. **Make it actionable**: Every section should guide future writing

## Adaptation for Different Formats

**For a skill SKILL.md**: 
- Use more directive language ("Use X" vs "Author uses X")
- Add a "When to Apply" section
- Include a "Before Writing" checklist
- Put extensive examples in a separate references file

**For a project conventions document**:
- Focus on the rules and preferences
- Skip the "Overview" narrative
- Emphasize the quick reference checklist
- Include links to example files in the project

**For a style analysis document**:
- Keep the analytical tone
- Include more "observed patterns" language
- Add statistical breakdowns if relevant
- Note variations and exceptions
