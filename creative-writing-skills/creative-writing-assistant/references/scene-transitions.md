# Scene Transitions (Fallback Reference)

**Note**: This is a fallback reference for projects with NO established transition guides. Always prioritize project-specific conventions.

## Types of Scene Breaks

### Time Jumps

**Short time (hours)**:
```markdown
The sun was setting when she finally made it home.

By morning, she'd made her decision.
```

**Medium time (days/weeks)**:
```markdown
Three days later, the results came back.

The next week crawled by.
```

**Long time (months/years)**:
```markdown
Six months passed before she saw him again.

It took two years to rebuild.
```

### Location Changes

**Clear markers**:
```markdown
The office was quiet when she arrived.

The café bustled with morning traffic.
```

**Transitional movement**:
```markdown
She locked the office door and headed downtown.

The café was only a few blocks away, but she took her time.
```

### POV Changes

**Clear scene break** (white space, asterisks, or chapter break):
```markdown
Sarah watched him leave, wondering if he'd come back.

* * *

Marcus didn't look back. He couldn't afford to.
```

**Same scene, different focus**:
```markdown
Sarah tensed as the door opened.

From the doorway, Marcus could see her fear.
```

### Emotional Shifts

**Transition from intense to calm**:
```markdown
She collapsed against the door, heart racing.

After a few minutes, the panic subsided. She took a breath.
```

**Transition from calm to intense**:
```markdown
The morning was peaceful, birds singing in the trees.

Then she saw the blood.
```

## Scene Break Markers

### White Space

Just skip a line (or several) between scenes:

```markdown
She closed the door behind her.


The apartment was empty when Marcus arrived.
```

### Symbols

Common markers:
- `* * *` (three asterisks)
- `---` (three em dashes)
- `# # #` (three hashtags)
- `• • •` (three bullets)

```markdown
She closed the door behind her.

* * *

The apartment was empty when Marcus arrived.
```

Choose one and be consistent.

### Chapter Breaks

Major transitions warrant new chapters:
- Significant time jumps
- Major plot shifts
- POV character changes
- Act or section transitions

## Transition Techniques

### Linking Sentences

**Last line of scene connects to first line of next**:
```markdown
She wondered if he'd make it in time.

He wasn't going to make it in time.
```

**Thematic connection**:
```markdown
The rain had finally stopped.

Sarah's tears, however, hadn't.
```

**Question and answer**:
```markdown
Where had he gone?

Marcus was three states away by sunrise.
```

### Temporal Markers

**Explicit time references**:
- "The next morning..."
- "Two hours later..."
- "By midnight..."
- "Three days had passed..."

**Implicit time markers**:
- "The coffee had gone cold." (time has passed)
- "The sun was setting." (time of day established)
- "By the time she finished..." (duration indicated)

### Emotional Continuity

**Carry emotion across break**:
```markdown
She left the room, anger burning in her chest.

The anger hadn't faded by morning.
```

**Contrast emotions**:
```markdown
She went to bed frustrated and alone.

She woke to the smell of coffee and the sound of someone in her kitchen.
```

## Opening New Scenes

### Orient Quickly

Readers need to know:
- **Who** (POV character if changed)
- **Where** (location if changed)
- **When** (time if changed)

Do this in the first few sentences.

**Good orientation**:
```markdown
Marcus found her at the café three blocks from her apartment. It was Tuesday morning, and the place was nearly empty.
```

We know: Marcus, café, Tuesday morning.

**Poor orientation**:
```markdown
He walked in and sat down. The place was empty.
```

Who is "he"? Where is "the place"? When is this?

### Grounding Details

Include one or two sensory details to anchor the reader:

```markdown
The hospital smelled of disinfectant and bad coffee. Sarah checked her phone—2 AM—and settled into the uncomfortable waiting room chair.
```

Smell, time, physical sensation—reader is grounded.

## Pacing with Transitions

### Fast Pacing

**Quick cuts, minimal transition**:
```markdown
"Run!"

* * *

They made it to the car.

* * *

Highway. Eighty miles an hour.

* * *

"We lost them."
```

### Slow Pacing

**Detailed transitions, emphasize passage of time**:
```markdown
The afternoon stretched into evening. She watched the shadows lengthen across the floor, marking time by the sun's movement. By the time darkness fell, she'd made her decision.

The next morning was cold and clear.
```

### Rhythm Variation

Mix fast and slow:
- Action → brief transition → action (maintain momentum)
- Intense scene → longer transition → reflective scene (give breathing room)

## Handling Flashbacks

### Clear Entry

**Explicit marker**:
```markdown
Sarah stared at the photograph. The memory came rushing back.

*Ten years ago...*

She'd been standing in this same spot.
```

**Gradual shift**:
```markdown
The smell of coffee reminded her of that morning. The morning everything changed.

She'd woken early, unable to sleep.
```

### Clear Exit

**Return to present**:
```markdown
She shook off the memory and put the photo down. That was then. This was now.
```

**Thematic bridge**:
```markdown
She'd made the same choice then that she was making now.

No more running.
```

## Common Transition Mistakes

### Disorienting Jumps

**Bad**:
```markdown
"I don't believe you."

The restaurant was crowded.
```

Wait, where did they go? When? How?

**Better**:
```markdown
"I don't believe you."

She stood. "We're done here."

* * *

The restaurant was crowded, but Marcus spotted her in the corner booth.
```

### Over-Explanation

**Too much**:
```markdown
After leaving the office, Sarah drove home, which took approximately thirty minutes in light traffic. She parked in her usual spot, walked up the two flights of stairs to her apartment, unlocked the door, went inside, and set her keys on the counter.
```

**Better**:
```markdown
By the time she got home, dusk had fallen.
```

### Inconsistent Markers

**Confusing**:
```markdown
Scene 1 ends...

* * *

Scene 2 starts...

---

Scene 3 starts...

###

Scene 4 starts...
```

Pick one marker style and stick with it.

## Special Transitions

### Montage/Time Compression

```markdown
The days blurred together. Training. Sleeping. Training again. Sarah's body learned what her mind resisted.

By the end of the month, she could do it without thinking.
```

### Parallel Action

**Cut between simultaneous events**:
```markdown
Sarah ran.

* * *

Marcus was halfway across town when his phone rang.

* * *

She made it to the bridge.

* * *

He answered. "Where is she?"
```

### Dream/Reality Transitions

**Clear marking**:
```markdown
She fell asleep.

In the dream, she was falling.

She jerked awake, heart pounding.
```

## Remember

Good transitions:
- Orient the reader quickly
- Maintain appropriate pacing
- Feel natural, not forced
- Serve the story's rhythm
- Are consistent in style

Bad transitions:
- Leave reader confused about who/where/when
- Are overly detailed about unimportant moments
- Break immersion with clunky markers
- Don't match the story's pacing needs

When your project has specific transition guides, follow those instead of these generic techniques.
