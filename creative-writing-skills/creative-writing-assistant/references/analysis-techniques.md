# Writing Sample Analysis Techniques

This guide provides detailed techniques for analyzing writing samples to extract style patterns.

## Systematic Analysis Approach

### 1. First Pass: Overall Impression

Before detailed analysis, read through and note:
- Overall tone and voice
- What feels distinctive or unusual
- First impressions of pacing and rhythm
- Emotional effect

### 2. Sentence-Level Analysis

Count and measure:
- Total sentences in sample
- Words per sentence (calculate average)
- Shortest and longest sentences
- Standard deviation (if you want to quantify variation)

Look for patterns:
- Do short and long sentences alternate intentionally?
- Are fragments used? In what contexts?
- Complex vs. simple sentence ratio
- Subordinate clause frequency

**Example analysis**:
```
Sample: 1,247 words, 87 sentences
Average: 14.3 words/sentence
Range: 3-42 words
Pattern: Alternates long (20+) with short (5-10) clusters
Fragments: 8 instances, all in dialogue or thought
```

### 3. Punctuation Audit

Create a frequency table:
```
Em dashes: 23 instances → formatted as `---` (100%)
Ellipsis: 7 instances → formatted as `...` (100%)
Semicolons: 2 instances
Colons: 8 instances
Exclamation: 12 instances → 11 in dialogue, 1 in narration
Question marks: 15 instances → 14 in dialogue, 1 in narration
Parentheses: 0 instances
```

Note the ratio:
- Punctuation per paragraph
- Punctuation in dialogue vs. narration
- Consistent formatting choices

### 4. Dialogue Deep Dive

Analyze dialogue structure:

**Tags**:
- Count total dialogue lines
- Count tagged lines
- Count action-beat lines
- Count tag-free lines

**Tag variety**:
- "Said": X instances
- "Asked": X instances
- Other verbs: List them
- Tag position: Before/after ratio

**Speech patterns**:
- Contraction frequency in dialogue
- Fragment frequency
- Interruptions (count em-dashes mid-dialogue)
- Trailing off (count ellipses)

**Example**:
```
Dialogue analysis:
- 45 total dialogue lines
- 18 with "said" tags (40%)
- 20 with action beats (44%)
- 7 tag-free (16%)
- Tag alternatives: "asked" (3), "replied" (1), "whispered" (2)
- Contractions: 38/45 lines (84%)
```

### 5. Descriptive Density Mapping

Mark each paragraph by type:
- D = Dialogue-heavy
- A = Action-focused
- E = External description (setting/environment)
- I = Internal (thoughts/feelings)

Count sentences of pure description:
- How many per chapter/section?
- Average length of descriptive passages?
- Where do they occur? (Opening, transitions, never?)

### 6. Sensory Inventory

Count references to each sense:
```
Visual: 47 references (colors, appearance, spatial)
Auditory: 23 references (sounds, volume, tone)
Tactile: 12 references (temperature, texture, pressure)
Olfactory: 3 references (smells)
Gustatory: 1 reference (taste)
Proprioceptive: 8 references (body awareness, balance)
```

This reveals sensory priorities.

### 7. POV and Distance Analysis

Check for filter words (count each):
- "saw/seen"
- "heard"
- "felt/feeling"
- "noticed"
- "realized"
- "thought"
- "wondered"
- "knew/know"

Calculate percentage of sentences containing filter words.

**Distance indicators**:
- How often does narration use character's vocabulary?
- Are there sentences that couldn't be in-character thought?
- Does tone shift between narration and character voice?

### 8. Metaphor and Simile Census

Count and categorize:
```
Similes (using "like/as"): 8 instances
Metaphors (direct equation): 5 instances
Extended metaphors: 1 instance

Types:
- Nature-based: 6
- Mechanical: 3
- Abstract: 4

Complexity:
- Single-word: 7
- Phrase: 5
- Extended: 1
```

### 9. Temporal Analysis

Map the narrative timeline:
- How much time passes in the sample?
- How is time passage indicated?
- Scene vs. summary ratio

Count time markers:
- Explicit: "Three days later"
- Implicit: "By morning"
- Through action: "The coffee had gone cold"

### 10. Paragraph Pattern Analysis

Measure paragraphs:
- Count total paragraphs
- Average sentences per paragraph
- Single-sentence paragraphs: Count and context
- Longest paragraph: X sentences
- Shortest: X sentences

Look for patterns:
- Long paragraphs for description, short for action?
- Single-line for emphasis or dialogue?
- Consistent length or highly varied?

## Pattern Recognition Tips

### Identifying Signature Moves

Look for techniques used repeatedly:
- Unusual metaphor types
- Specific transition phrases
- Characteristic rhythm patterns
- Unique structural choices

**Example**: "Author often ends scenes with a single-line paragraph that shifts emotional tone"

### Distinguishing Intentional from Accidental

A pattern is likely intentional if:
- It appears consistently (80%+ of instances)
- It serves a clear purpose
- It's absent when that purpose isn't needed
- It varies in predictable, context-dependent ways

**Example**: 
- Intentional: Always uses em dashes for interruptions
- Accidental: Sometimes writes "alright" and sometimes "all right" (inconsistency, not pattern)

### Noting Absences

What's NOT in the writing is revealing:
- Never uses adverbs with dialogue tags
- Avoids physical description of characters
- Doesn't use flashbacks
- No internal monologue

Absence patterns are style features too.

### Context-Dependent Variations

Check if style changes with:
- Scene type (dialogue vs. action vs. reflection)
- Emotional intensity
- Character whose POV is active
- Time of day or setting

**Example**: "Sentence length drops to 8-word average during action scenes vs. 15-word average in dialogue scenes"

## Quantification Guidelines

### When to Count

Count when the pattern is:
- Potentially significant
- Observable enough to quantify
- Variable enough that quantity matters

**Examples**:
- Sentence length (matters)
- Comma usage (probably doesn't matter)
- Dialogue tags (matters)
- Individual word frequency (usually doesn't matter unless signature word)

### How to Present Numbers

**Be specific but not absurd**:
- "Average 14 words/sentence" ✓
- "Average 14.327 words/sentence" ✗ (false precision)

**Use ranges when appropriate**:
- "5-15 words per sentence" ✓
- "Exactly 10 words per sentence" ✗ (unless true)

**Provide context**:
- "2-3 em dashes per paragraph" ✓
- "23 em dashes" ✗ (meaningless without context)

## Sample Analysis Walkthrough

### Raw Sample (300 words)

> The door opened. Sarah stepped through, and the smell hit her immediately—chlorine and something else, something organic and wrong. The pool stretched before her, its surface mirror-still despite the pumps humming somewhere beneath.
>
> "You came." Marcus stood at the far end, hands in his pockets. He looked smaller than she remembered. Younger.
>
> "Did I have a choice?" She walked closer, footsteps echoing off tile.
>
> "There's always a choice." He pulled something from his pocket. A key. "But you knew that."
>
> The water was murky. Green-tinted. Sarah stopped five feet from the edge, close enough to see but far enough to run. "What happened here?"
>
> He didn't answer right away. Just stared at the water like it might tell him something. Finally: "We pushed too hard. Tried to make it work faster than it wanted to."
>
> "And?"
>
> "And now we're here." He held out the key. "Your call."

- Tension through what's unsaid

## Common Analysis Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Over-interpreting

**Wrong**: "The author always uses 14-word sentences"
**Right**: "Sentences average 14 words, ranging from 5-25"

### Mistake 2: Under-sampling

**Wrong**: Drawing conclusions from one 500-word sample
**Right**: Analyzing 2,000+ words across varied scenes

### Mistake 3: Ignoring Context

**Wrong**: "Uses short sentences" (without noting when)
**Right**: "Uses short sentences (5-8 words) during action; longer (15-20) during reflection"

### Mistake 4: Codifying Errors

**Wrong**: Including typos or inconsistencies as style features
**Right**: Only including intentional, repeated patterns

### Mistake 5: Being Too Vague

**Wrong**: "Uses description sparingly"
**Right**: "2-3 sentences of description per scene, focused on sensory atmosphere over visual detail"

## Delivering Analysis Results

### Be Comprehensive But Readable

Structure findings logically:
1. Most distinctive features first
2. Group related patterns together
3. Use headers and white space
4. Include specific examples

### Balance Numbers and Narrative

Don't just list statistics. Explain what they mean:

**Poor**: "14 words/sentence, 23 em dashes, 5 fragments"

**Better**: "Sentences average 14 words, creating a moderate, flowing pace. Em dashes appear frequently (2-3 per paragraph) to create parenthetical asides or show interruption. Fragments are used sparingly (5% of sentences) and only for emphasis in character thought or dialogue."

### Show, Don't Just Tell

Every pattern should have an example from the original sample demonstrating it in context.
