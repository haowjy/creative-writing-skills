## Usage Guidelines

### YAML Frontmatter

All pages should include YAML frontmatter with:
- `title`: The page name
- `type`: Page type (character, location, lore, etc.)
- `created`: Creation date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `updated`: Last update date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Additional fields specific to page type

### Writing Style

- **Third person**: "Sarah is a..." not "You are a..."
- **Past tense**: For completed events
- **Present tense**: For current status/descriptions
- **Neutral tone**: Encyclopedic, not narrative
- **No spoiler warnings**: Just mark pages with spoiler frontmatter if needed

### Citations

Always cite sources:
- `Chapter X` for chapter references
- `Chapter X, Page Y` for specific locations
- `[Character Name]'s backstory` for derived information

### Cross-Referencing

Link to related pages:
- Use internal links: `[Character Name](character-name.md)`
- Mention related concepts
- Build interconnected wiki

### Customization

These are templates - adapt to your project's needs:
- Add sections specific to your world
- Remove irrelevant sections
- Adjust frontmatter fields
- Create new templates for unique page types
