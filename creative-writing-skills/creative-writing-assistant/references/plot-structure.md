# Plot & Structure Analysis

This reference covers analyzing story structure, plot holes, cause-and-effect, setup-payoff, and arc development.

## What to Analyze

### Story Structure Frameworks

Check if the story follows (or effectively subverts) common structures:

**Three-Act Structure**:
- Act 1: Setup, inciting incident (first 25%)
- Act 2: Rising action, midpoint, complications (middle 50%)
- Act 3: Climax, resolution (final 25%)

**Hero's Journey**:
- Ordinary world → Call to adventure → Refusal → Mentor → Threshold
- Tests → Approach → Ordeal → Reward → Road back
- Resurrection → Return with elixir

**Kishōtenketsu** (East Asian structure):
- Ki (introduction) → Shō (development) → Ten (twist/complication) → Ketsu (conclusion)

**Key questions**:
- Does the structure support the story's needs?
- Are structural beats in roughly the right places?
- If subverting structure, is it intentional and effective?

### Cause and Effect Chains

Every event should logically lead to the next:

**Check for**:
- Does Event A naturally cause Event B?
- Are character decisions logical given what they know?
- Do consequences match actions?
- Are coincidences overused?

**Red flags**:
- "And then..." plots (random events, no causation)
- Deus ex machina solutions
- Contrived conflicts that could be resolved with conversation
- Characters acting illogically to force plot forward

**Example issues**:
- Character doesn't call for help when they obviously should
- Villain explains plan instead of just winning
- Crucial information withheld from reader for artificial suspense
- Convenient coincidences rescue characters repeatedly

### Plot Holes and Logic Gaps

**Common plot holes**:
- Technology/magic that could solve problems but is forgotten
- Inconsistent world rules (magic works differently when convenient)
- Characters knowing things they shouldn't
- Travel time inconsistencies
- Missing obvious solutions
- Forgotten subplots or characters

**How to identify**:
- Ask "Why doesn't character just...?"
- Check if established rules are followed
- Verify timeline makes sense
- Track what each character knows and when
- Look for abandoned setup without payoff

### Setup and Payoff

**Chekhov's Gun principle**: If you show a gun in Act 1, it must go off by Act 3.

**Check for**:
- Early details that pay off later (good)
- Early details that never matter (problem)
- Late revelations with no setup (problem)
- Clues that are too obvious or too hidden

**Foreshadowing effectiveness**:
- Does it feel natural in context?
- Is it discoverable on re-read but not obvious first time?
- Does the payoff feel earned?

**Red flags**:
- Major plot twists with zero setup (readers feel cheated)
- Elaborate setup that never pays off (readers feel misled)
- All setup in exposition rather than woven into story

### Arc Development

**Plot arcs** should have:
- Clear beginning state
- Escalating complications
- Turning points
- Satisfying resolution

**Character arcs** should show:
- Initial state/want
- Challenges to that state
- Change or deliberate refusal to change
- New state/realization

**Relationship arcs**:
- Initial dynamic
- Events that strain or strengthen
- Evolution over time
- Changed or deepened understanding

**Thematic arcs**:
- Question posed early
- Explored through events
- Answer or complexity revealed

**Issues to identify**:
- Flat arcs (nothing changes)
- Incomplete arcs (start but don't finish)
- Too many simultaneous arcs (reader confusion)
- Arcs that resolve too early (leaving dead story time)
- Rushed resolution after slow buildup

## Analysis Approach

### Map the Structure

Create a structural outline:
1. What happens in each scene/chapter?
2. What are the major turning points?
3. Where is the midpoint?
4. Where does the climax occur?

### Test Causation

For each major event, ask:
- What caused this to happen?
- Is that cause logical and established?
- What are the consequences?
- Do those consequences follow logically?

### Track Setups

Note elements introduced early:
- Do they pay off?
- When do they pay off?
- Is the wait too long or too short?
- Are clues fair or arbitrary?

### Check Logic

Play devil's advocate:
- "Why doesn't character just [obvious solution]?"
- "How did character know that?"
- "Why would villain do that?"
- "Does this timeline make sense?"

## Common Structural Issues

### The Saggy Middle

**Symptoms**:
- Chapters 10-20 feel directionless
- Characters spinning wheels
- Subplots dominate main plot
- Reader asks "where is this going?"

**Solutions**:
- Add midpoint twist that changes the game
- Escalate stakes
- Complicate the plan
- Reveal new information
- Make things worse before better

### False Start

**Symptoms**:
- Real story begins chapter 3-5
- Opening chapters are backstory/world setup
- Inciting incident takes too long

**Solutions**:
- Start later (cut early chapters)
- Weave backstory into action
- Begin with the inciting incident

### Rushed Ending

**Symptoms**:
- Slow buildup, then sudden rapid resolution
- Final act feels like a different pace
- Climax is over too quickly
- Multiple threads resolved in one scene

**Solutions**:
- Give climax proper space to breathe
- Resolve threads sequentially, not simultaneously
- Cut earlier slow sections to balance pacing

### Too Many Subplots

**Symptoms**:
- Main plot gets lost
- Too much time away from protagonist
- Threads don't weave together
- Reader forgets what's happening in Plot B

**Solutions**:
- Cut subplots that don't serve main story
- Weave subplots into main plot
- Resolve some subplots earlier
- Make subplots directly affect main plot

### Weak Stakes

**Symptoms**:
- "So what if they fail?"
- Consequences feel abstract
- Personal stakes missing
- Stakes don't escalate

**Solutions**:
- Add personal consequences
- Show what will be lost
- Make failure tangible
- Escalate stakes at key moments

## Providing Feedback

**What's working**: [Specific structural strengths]

**Concerns**: [Specific structural issues]

## Cause and Effect

2. [Another issue]

## Setup and Payoff

**Effective setups**:
- [Element] introduced in [chapter] pays off in [chapter]

**Unfired guns**:
- [Element] introduced but never used
- [Element] needs payoff

**Insufficient setup**:
- [Plot point] needs earlier foreshadowing

## Arc Development

**Plot arc**: [Assessment - clear/muddled, complete/incomplete]

**Character arc**: [Assessment]

**Missing arcs**: [What else might benefit from arc structure]

## Recommendations

1. [Most critical structural fix]
2. [Second priority]
3. [Third priority]
```

### Be Specific

**Vague**: "The plot has holes"
**Specific**: "In Chapter 5, Sarah uses magic to escape, but earlier in Chapter 2, it's established that magic doesn't work in iron cages. This needs reconciliation."

**Vague**: "The pacing is off"
**Specific**: "Chapters 8-12 feel slow because the protagonist is waiting for information. Consider adding a complication or subplot that gives them something active to do during this period."

### Prioritize Issues

Not all problems are equal:

**Critical** (story-breaking):
- Major plot holes
- Causation failures
- Missing or rushed climax

**Important** (reader confusion):
- Unclear structure
- Weak middle
- Setup without payoff

**Minor** (polish issues):
- Small logic gaps
- Timing minutiae
- Subtle structural improvements

Focus feedback on critical and important issues first.

## Genre Considerations

### Mystery/Thriller
- Fair play: Are clues available to reader?
- Red herrings: Misleading but not cheating
- Revelation timing: Not too early, not too late
- Logic: Solution must make sense

### Romance
- Meet cute/inciting incident
- Relationship development beats
- Conflict that keeps them apart (believable)
- Satisfying resolution (genre-appropriate)

### Fantasy/Sci-Fi
- World rules must be consistent
- Magic/tech can't arbitrarily solve problems
- Worldbuilding integrated into plot
- Stakes clear despite unfamiliar setting

### Literary Fiction
- Structure can be more experimental
- Character arc often more important than plot arc
- Ambiguous endings acceptable
- Theme development crucial

### Horror
- Escalating dread structure
- Rules of the threat established early
- Protagonist must face the horror
- Payoff scares set up properly

Adjust structural expectations based on genre conventions.
