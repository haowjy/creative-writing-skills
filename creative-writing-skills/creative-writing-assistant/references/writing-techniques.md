# Writing Techniques (Fallback Reference)

**Note**: This is a fallback reference for projects with NO established style guides. Always prioritize project-specific conventions over these generic techniques.

## Basic Prose Principles

### Show, Don't Tell

**Telling**: She was angry.
**Showing**: Her hands clenched. "Get out."

**When to show**:
- Important emotional moments
- Character reactions to events
- Building atmosphere and immersion

**When to tell**:
- Transitional information
- Minor details
- Time passage
- Background information

### Vary Sentence Length

**Monotonous**: "She opened the door. She walked inside. She saw the mess. She was shocked."

**Varied**: "She opened the door and froze. The apartment was destroyedâ€”furniture overturned, papers scattered everywhere. Her hands shook."

Mix short punchy sentences with longer flowing ones for rhythm.

### Use Active Voice (Usually)

**Passive**: The door was opened by her.
**Active**: She opened the door.

Active voice is clearer and stronger in most cases. Use passive only when appropriate (actor unknown, emphasizing object).

### Cut Filter Words

**With filters**: She saw the blood on the floor. She felt her heart racing.
**Without**: Blood pooled on the floor. Her heart raced.

Remove "saw, heard, felt, thought, noticed, seemed" for immediacy and deeper POV.

### Use Specific Details

**Vague**: The building was big.
**Specific**: The mansion loomed three stories high, its Gothic spires piercing the fog.

**Vague**: She moved quickly.
**Specific**: She sprinted down the alley.

Concrete, specific language creates clearer images.

## POV and Distance

### Deep POV
Stay close to character's perspective:
- Use their vocabulary and thought patterns in narration
- Avoid filter words
- Let their biases color descriptions
- Show world through their eyes

### Maintaining Consistent POV
- If third-person limited, stay in one head per scene
- Don't head-hop without clear scene breaks
- Show other characters through POV character's perception

## Description Techniques

### Sensory Details
Beyond visual:
- **Sound**: distant sirens, rustling leaves, creaking floorboards
- **Smell**: ozone, coffee, musty basement
- **Touch**: rough bark, silk fabric, cold metal
- **Taste**: bitter medicine, sweet honey
- **Temperature**: stifling heat, biting cold

### Distributing Description
Don't info-dump all description at once. Sprinkle throughout action:

**Bad**: "The room was 20x30 feet with blue walls, hardwood floors, three windows facing east, a fireplace on the north wall, two doors, and antique furniture including a mahogany desk, leather chair, and bookshelf filled with leather-bound volumes."

**Better**: "She entered the study. Sunlight streamed through tall windows, illuminating dust motes above the hardwood floor. A mahogany desk dominated the space, leather-bound books lining the shelves behind it."

## Pacing

### Scene vs. Summary

**Scene**: Real-time, with dialogue and action
- Use for important moments
- Conflict and confrontation
- Emotional beats
- Plot-critical events

**Summary**: Compressed time
- Use for routine activities
- Travel without incident
- Time passage
- Less important events

### Creating Tension
- Put obstacles in the way of goals
- Raise stakes progressively
- Use deadlines
- Create uncertainty about outcomes
- Show character vulnerability

## Dialogue

### Make It Sound Natural
- Use contractions (I'm, don't, can't)
- Include fragments and interruptions
- People don't speak in perfect sentences
- Let characters talk over each other occasionally

### Avoid Info-Dumping
**Bad**: "As you know, Sarah, we've been friends since third grade when we met at Lincoln Elementary, and you've always been afraid of heights ever since that incident at summer camp."

**Better**: "You sure you're okay with this?" He gestured at the cliff edge. "I remember summer camp..."

She grimaced. "I'm fine."

### Use Subtext
Characters don't always say what they mean:

**On-the-nose**: "I'm angry at you for forgetting my birthday."

**With subtext**: "Don't worry about it. I'm sure you had more important things to remember."

## Chapter and Scene Structure

### Strong Openings
- Start in the middle of action when possible
- Orient reader quickly (who, where, when)
- Create immediate interest or question

### Strong Endings
- End with hooks that pull reader forward
- Questions raised
- Cliffhangers
- Promises of conflict ahead
- Avoid resolution that makes stopping easy

### Transitions
- Use clear time markers ("Three days later")
- Orient reader quickly after scene breaks
- Maintain emotional or thematic continuity

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Purple Prose
**Too ornate**: "The resplendent, golden orb of incandescent daylight ascended majestically above the cerulean horizon."

**Better**: "The sun rose over the ocean."

Keep prose clear first, beautiful second.

### Adverb Overuse
**Weak**: He ran quickly. She said angrily.

**Stronger**: He sprinted. "Get out!" She slammed the door.

Show emotion through action, not adverbs.

### Telling Emotions
**Bad**: She felt sad. He was nervous.

**Better**: Tears blurred her vision. His hands trembled.

Physical manifestations instead of emotion labels.

### Starting Too Early
Begin as close to the action as possible. Cut backstory dumps at the opening.

## Remember

These are **general guidelines**, not absolute rules. Every story and writer is different. What matters most is:

- Clarity (readers understand what's happening)
- Consistency (maintaining patterns throughout)
- Serving the story (techniques serve narrative, not the reverse)

When a project has specific style guides, follow those instead of these generic suggestions.
