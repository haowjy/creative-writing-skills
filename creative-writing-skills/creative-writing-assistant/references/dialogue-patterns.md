# Dialogue Patterns (Fallback Reference)

**Note**: This is a fallback reference for projects with NO established dialogue guides. Always prioritize project-specific conventions.

## Basic Dialogue Formatting

### Standard Format

```markdown
"Hello," she said.

He nodded. "Good to see you."

"How have you been?" She sat down across from him.

"Better." He stirred his coffee. "Much better."
```

### Action Beats vs. Dialogue Tags

**Dialogue tags**: "He said," "she asked"
**Action beats**: Physical actions that attribute dialogue

```markdown
"I don't believe you," Sarah said.  [tag]

Sarah crossed her arms. "I don't believe you."  [action beat]
```

Both work. Use whichever flows better in context.

## Natural Speech Patterns

### Use Contractions

**Formal/unnatural**: "I do not think that is a good idea."
**Natural**: "I don't think that's a good idea."

Exception: Characters might avoid contractions when being formal, careful, or if English isn't their first language.

### Fragments Are Okay

People don't always speak in complete sentences:

```markdown
"You coming?"

"Maybe. Depends."

"On?"

"Whether she'll be there."
```

### Interruptions and Overlaps

**Em dash for interruption**:
```markdown
"I think we should—"

"No." He held up his hand. "Just no."
```

**Ellipsis for trailing off**:
```markdown
"I wanted to say..." She looked away. "Never mind."
```

### Realistic Imperfections

- People repeat themselves
- Use filler words occasionally ("um," "uh," "like")
- Start sentences one way, finish another
- Don't always answer the question asked

But don't overdo it—too much makes dialogue hard to read.

## Dialogue Tags

### "Said" Is Invisible

Readers' eyes skip over "said." Use it freely.

```markdown
"I'm worried," she said.

"Why?" he said.

"Something feels wrong," she said.
```

This doesn't feel repetitive to readers.

### Avoid Fancy Alternatives

**Distracting**: "I don't understand," she queried.
"You never do," he retorted.
"That's not fair," she ejaculated.

**Better**: "I don't understand," she said.
"You never do."
"That's not fair."

Occasional alternatives (whispered, shouted, muttered) when volume/manner matters. Otherwise, stick with "said."

### Skip Tags When Clear

```markdown
"Are you coming?"

She shook her head. "Can't. Too much work."

"Your loss."

"I know."
```

No tags needed when context makes speaker obvious.

### Don't Add Adverbs to Tags

**Weak**: "I hate you," she said angrily.
**Better**: "I hate you." She slammed the door.

Show emotion through dialogue content or action, not adverbs.

## Subtext and Depth

### People Don't Say What They Mean

**On-the-nose**:
```markdown
"I'm jealous of your success."

"That's why you've been distant lately."
```

**With subtext**:
```markdown
"Congratulations on the promotion."

"Thanks."

"Must be nice." She stirred her drink. "Some of us are still stuck in the same place."

"Yeah." He cleared his throat. "Lucky break, I guess."
```

The jealousy is there, but unspoken.

### Conflict in Dialogue

Characters can disagree about:
- Facts (what happened)
- Interpretations (what it means)
- Priorities (what matters)
- Actions (what to do)

```markdown
"We should leave now."

"The storm will pass."

"You don't know that."

"I know we can't travel in this."

"And I know we can't stay here."
```

## Voice Distinction

### Different Characters Should Sound Different

**Educated professor**: "The empirical evidence suggests otherwise."
**Teenager**: "Yeah, that's not really how it works."
**Mechanic**: "Look, I've been doing this twenty years. Trust me."

Vary:
- Vocabulary (simple/complex, formal/casual)
- Sentence structure (short/long, complete/fragments)
- Verbal tics (repeated phrases)
- Directness (blunt/evasive)

### Consistency Within Characters

Once you establish how a character talks, maintain it unless there's a reason for change.

## Dialogue Purpose

Every line should serve at least one purpose:

- **Advance plot**: Reveal information, make decisions, create plans
- **Reveal character**: Show personality, values, relationships
- **Create tension**: Conflict, subtext, stakes
- **Set tone**: Humor, drama, atmosphere

If dialogue doesn't serve a purpose, cut it.

### Avoid Small Talk (Usually)

**Boring**:
```markdown
"Hi."

"Hi. How are you?"

"Fine. You?"

"Good. Nice weather."

"Yeah."
```

**Better—start mid-conversation**:
```markdown
"I can't keep doing this."

He looked up from his phone. "Doing what?"

"Pretending everything's fine."
```

Skip greetings and pleasantries unless they serve a purpose.

## Info-Dumping

### Don't Explain Through Dialogue What Characters Already Know

**Bad—"As you know" syndrome**:
```markdown
"As you know, Sarah, we've been best friends since we were eight years old, and you've always had a phobia of water ever since that swimming pool incident when you nearly drowned."
```

**Better**:
```markdown
"You sure about this?" He gestured at the lake.

She swallowed. "I'm fine."

"You don't look fine."

"I said I'm fine."
```

The water fear is shown through reaction, not explained.

### Break Up Exposition

If you must deliver information through dialogue:
- Spread it across multiple conversations
- Have a character who genuinely doesn't know ask
- Use action to demonstrate instead
- Let context provide information

## Dialogue Rhythm

### Vary Exchange Length

**Monotonous—all short**:
```markdown
"No."

"Why?"

"Because."

"That's not an answer."

"Yes it is."
```

**Better—mix lengths**:
```markdown
"No."

"Why not? You said you'd think about it."

"I did think about it." She stood, pacing. "I thought about how it would mean leaving everything behind. How it would mean lying to everyone I know. How it would mean becoming someone I'm not."

He was quiet for a moment. "Or becoming who you really are."
```

### Quick Exchanges for Tension

Short, rapid back-and-forth creates urgency:

```markdown
"Go!"

"What about—"

"Now!"

"But—"

"Sarah, GO!"
```

### Longer Speeches for Impact

Occasionally, a character needs more space:

```markdown
"You want to know why I left?" He turned to face her. "Because every day I stayed was another day I was lying. Another day pretending I was happy when I was dying inside. Another day watching you build a life I couldn't be part of. I left because staying would have destroyed me. And maybe that makes me selfish. Maybe it makes me a coward. But it's the truth."
```

Use sparingly for maximum impact.

## Formatting Guidelines

### Paragraphing

- New speaker = new paragraph
- Action by new person = new paragraph
- Action by speaker = same paragraph as their dialogue

```markdown
"I don't understand." Sarah leaned forward.

Marcus shook his head. "I can't explain it."

"Try." She grabbed his hand. "Please try."
```

### Em Dashes and Ellipsis

**Em dash (—) for interruption**:
```markdown
"I think we should—"

"No."
```

**Ellipsis (...) for trailing off**:
```markdown
"I wanted to say..." She looked away.
```

### Internal Thought vs. Spoken Dialogue

Make clear what's thought vs. said:

```markdown
*I should tell her*, he thought. But instead he said, "Everything's fine."
```

Or use italics without tag:
```markdown
*I should tell her.* "Everything's fine."
```

## Common Dialogue Mistakes

### Everyone Sounds the Same

Give characters distinct voices through word choice, sentence structure, and speaking patterns.

### Too Much Exposition

Characters explaining things they both know, just to inform the reader.

### Perfect Speech

Real people stutter, hesitate, change subjects, misunderstand. Some imperfection adds realism.

### Overwritten Tags

Fancy alternatives to "said" and adverbs on tags draw attention away from dialogue.

### No Conflict

If everyone always agrees and speaks clearly, dialogue is boring. Add tension, misunderstanding, or subtext.

## Remember

Good dialogue:
- Sounds natural (but is more focused than real speech)
- Reveals character
- Advances story
- Creates or resolves tension
- Feels distinct to each character
- Serves multiple purposes at once

Bad dialogue:
- Is obviously exposition
- All sounds the same
- Meanders without purpose
- States emotions explicitly
- Uses fancy tags and adverbs

When your project has specific dialogue guides, follow those instead of these generic patterns.
