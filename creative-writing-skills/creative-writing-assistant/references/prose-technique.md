# Prose & Technical Analysis

This reference covers sentence clarity, variety, show vs. tell balance, word choice, filter words, passive voice, and prose style issues.

## What to Analyze

### Sentence Clarity

Can readers easily understand what's being said?

**Clear sentences**:
- Direct subject-verb-object
- Minimal nested clauses
- Appropriate length for content
- Logical flow

**Unclear sentences**:
- Ambiguous pronoun references
- Overly complex structure
- Too many ideas in one sentence
- Missing or vague subjects

**Examples**:

**Unclear**: "After seeing her, which reminded him of the time when they were younger and used to go there together, he decided not to go."
(Who is "her"? What is "there"? Too many clauses.)

**Clear**: "Seeing Sarah reminded him of their childhood visits to the lake. He decided not to go."

**Example issue**:
> "She walked into the room where it was and picked it up after she saw him look at it." What is "it"? This sentence has too many ambiguous pronouns. Be specific: "She walked into the kitchen and picked up the letter after seeing Marcus glance at it."

### Sentence Variety

Monotonous sentence patterns create boring rhythm.

**Check for**:
- **Length variation**: Mix short, medium, long
- **Structure variation**: Simple, compound, complex
- **Opening variation**: Don't start every sentence the same way
- **Rhythm**: Create musicality through variety

**Monotonous example**:
> She opened the door. She walked inside. She saw the mess. She was shocked.

All same length, all same structure (subject-verb-object).

**Varied example**:
> She opened the door and froze. The apartment was destroyed—furniture overturned, papers scattered, glass shattered across the floor. Her hands shook.

Mix of lengths and structures creates better rhythm.

**Example issue**:
> Chapter 4's prose is monotonous: nearly every sentence is 15-20 words with subject-verb-object structure. Vary length (some 5-word sentences, some 25+) and structure (try starting with participial phrases, dependent clauses, or objects).

### Show vs. Tell Balance

**Telling**: Stating information directly
> She was nervous.

**Showing**: Dramatizing through detail
> Her hands trembled as she reached for the door handle.

**When to show**:
- Important emotional moments
- Character reactions to events
- Pivotal scenes
- Building atmosphere
- Creating immersion

**When to tell**:
- Minor details
- Transitions
- Summary of routine events
- Background information
- Time passage

**Both have their place.** Over-showing creates bloated prose; over-telling creates distance.

**Examples**:

**Over-telling**:
> Sarah was devastated by her mother's death. She felt terrible grief and couldn't stop crying. She was very sad for weeks.

**Better (showing)**:
> Sarah couldn't enter her mother's room. The coffee mug still sat on the nightstand, lipstick mark on the rim. She made it to the doorway before the tears came again.

**Over-showing**:
> Her fingers, each one trembling like leaves in an autumn breeze, slowly, incrementally, moved toward the doorknob, which was made of brass and reflected the dim light from the hallway fixture above. [Too much detail for a minor action]

**Better (appropriate telling)**:
> She reached for the doorknob.

**Example issue**:
> Chapter 3's emotional climax is told rather than shown: "Marcus felt betrayed and hurt by Sarah's actions." This is the story's most important emotional moment—show his reaction through physical response, dialogue, and thought instead of summarizing his feelings.

### Filter Words

Filter words create distance by filtering experience through "thought," "saw," "felt," etc.

**Common filter words**:
- saw, watched, looked
- heard, listened
- felt, feeling
- thought, wondered, realized, knew
- noticed, seemed, appeared

**With filters**:
> She saw the door was open. She heard footsteps above. She felt afraid. She thought someone was in the house.

**Without filters (deeper POV)**:
> The door stood open. Footsteps creaked overhead. Someone was in the house.

**When filters are okay**:
- Emphasizing act of perception itself ("She watched him lie")
- Character awareness is the point
- Avoiding ambiguity
- Intentional distancing

**When to cut them**:
- Most of the time
- Deep POV scenes
- Action sequences
- Emotional intensity

**Example issue**:
> Chapter 6 overuses filter words, creating distance. "She saw the blood on the floor. She felt her heart racing. She heard sirens in the distance." Remove filters for immediacy: "Blood pooled on the floor. Her heart raced. Sirens wailed in the distance."

### Passive Voice

**Active**: Subject performs action
> Sarah opened the door.

**Passive**: Subject receives action
> The door was opened by Sarah.

**When passive is problematic**:
- Weakens prose
- Hides the actor
- Creates wordiness
- Reduces immediacy
- Muddles clarity

**When passive is appropriate**:
- Actor is unknown: "The window was broken"
- Actor is obvious: "The law was passed"
- Emphasizing object over actor: "The town was destroyed"
- Varying sentence structure

**Most prose should be active.** Passive has its place but shouldn't dominate.

**Example issue**:
> "The knife was picked up by Marcus. The door was opened by him. The hallway was walked through by him." This passive construction is wordy and weak. Active voice: "Marcus picked up the knife, opened the door, and walked through the hallway."

### Word Choice Precision

**Precise words**: Specific, concrete, vivid
> She sprinted. The mansion loomed. He devoured the sandwich.

**Vague words**: Generic, abstract, weak
> She moved quickly. The building was big. He ate the food.

**Weak verbs + adverbs can often be replaced with strong verbs**:
- walked slowly → ambled, trudged
- said loudly → shouted, yelled
- looked carefully → examined, scrutinized
- held tightly → clutched, gripped

**Example issue**:
> "She walked quickly" appears 12 times. Vary: ran, sprinted, hurried, rushed, jogged. Each has different connotations.

### Purple Prose

**Purple prose**: Overly ornate, flowery language that draws attention to itself.

**Symptoms**:
- Excessive adjectives/adverbs
- Overwrought metaphors
- Unnecessary complexity
- Showing off vocabulary
- Distracting from story

**Example**:
> The resplendent, golden orb of incandescent daylight ascended majestically above the azure, cerulean horizon of the vast, endless ocean.

**Better**:
> The sun rose over the ocean.

**Balance**: Rich description vs. clarity. Beautiful prose shouldn't sacrifice clarity or pull readers out of story.

**Example issue**:
> Chapter 1's opening is purple: "The melancholic tendrils of twilight's ephemeral embrace caressed the somnolent village." This draws attention to language instead of story. Simplify: "Twilight settled over the quiet village."

### Adverb Overuse

Adverbs (especially -ly words) can indicate weak writing.

**Problem adverbs**:
- Dialogue tags: said angrily, whispered quietly
- Obvious modifiers: completely destroyed, very unique
- Telling emotion: looked sadly, smiled happily

**When adverbs work**:
- Modifying in unexpected way: smiled cruelly
- Precision: slightly, nearly, almost
- No better alternative available

**Better than adverbs**:
- Strong verbs: ran quickly → sprinted
- Show don't tell: smiled happily → "Her eyes lit up as she smiled"
- Cut entirely if meaning is clear

**Example issue**:
> "He said angrily" appears 8 times. Show anger through dialogue content, word choice, or action beats. "'You're wrong,' he said, slamming his palm on the table."

### Repetitive Language

**Watch for**:
- Same word used multiple times in close proximity
- Repeated sentence structures
- Overused pet phrases
- Crutch words (just, really, very, thing)

**Example issue**:
> Chapter 3 uses "just" 47 times in 3,000 words. It's a filler word. Cut most instances: "She just wanted to go" → "She wanted to go." "He just sat there" → "He sat there."

## Analysis Approach

### Check for Clarity

Read several passages:
- Any confusing sentences?
- Ambiguous pronouns?
- Overly complex structures?
- Can meaning be misread?

### Test Sentence Variety

Pick 2-3 paragraphs:
- Count sentence lengths
- Note sentence structures
- Check opening words
- Is there variation or monotony?

### Show vs. Tell Audit

Find emotional/important moments:
- Are they shown or told?
- Should telling be showing?
- Is there over-showing of minor details?

### Filter Word Count

Search for filter words:
- How many instances?
- Are they necessary or distancing?
- Could they be cut for deeper POV?

### Passive Voice Check

Scan for "was/were" + past participle:
- How frequent is passive voice?
- Is it weakening the prose?
- Should any be made active?

### Word Choice Review

Look for:
- Vague words that could be specific
- Weak verb + adverb combinations
- Repeated words close together
- Crutch words overused

## Common Prose Issues

### Telling Instead of Showing

**Problem**: Important moments summarized instead of dramatized.

**Example**: "She was devastated" instead of showing grief through action/detail.

**Fix**: Show physical response, actions, dialogue, thoughts instead of labeling emotions.

### Monotonous Rhythm

**Problem**: All sentences same length/structure.

**Example**: All 15-word subject-verb-object sentences.

**Fix**: Vary length (short punchy and long flowing), vary structure (simple, compound, complex), vary openings.

### Distance from Deep POV

**Problem**: Filter words create distance.

**Example**: "She saw," "he felt," "she heard" everywhere.

**Fix**: Remove filters for immediacy. Trust readers to know we're in character's POV.

### Weak Verbs

**Problem**: Generic verbs + adverbs instead of strong specific verbs.

**Example**: "Walked slowly" instead of "trudged."

**Fix**: Replace verb + adverb with stronger single verb.

### Unclear Antecedents

**Problem**: Pronoun confusion—reader unsure what "it" or "they" refers to.

**Example**: "She told her that it was broken and she needed to fix it."

**Fix**: Use names/nouns when pronouns ambiguous.

### Be Specific with Examples

**Vague**: "Prose needs work"

**Specific**: "Chapter 5's emotional climax tells rather than shows. 'Marcus was heartbroken and angry' should be: 'Marcus stared at the letter, hands trembling. The words blurred. He crumpled it slowly, methodically, then hurled it across the room.' Show his heartbreak through physical response instead of labeling it."

**Vague**: "Sentences are boring"

**Specific**: "Paragraphs 2-5 on page 12 have monotonous rhythm: ten consecutive sentences of 15-17 words, all starting with subject-verb. Break this up: vary length (try a 5-word sentence, then a 30-word sentence), start some sentences with dependent clauses or participial phrases."

## Genre Considerations

### Literary Fiction
- Prose quality paramount
- Can be more stylized
- Beautiful language expected
- Show > tell usually

### Genre Fiction
- Clarity over beauty
- Fast-paced prose
- Less purple, more direct
- Efficiency matters

### YA
- Clear, accessible prose
- Voice important
- Not too complex
- Contemporary feel

### Thriller
- Tight, efficient
- Short sentences in action
- Clear and fast
- No purple prose

### Fantasy
- Can be more descriptive
- Worldbuilding needs prose space
- Balance detail with pace
- Clear despite complexity

Adjust prose expectations to genre standards.

## Remember

Good prose is **clear first**, then beautiful. Readers should experience the story, not notice the writing (unless it's literary fiction where language IS part of the experience). Clarity, variety, and appropriate showing create engaging prose.
