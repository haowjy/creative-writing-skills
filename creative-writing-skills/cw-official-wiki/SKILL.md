# Official Wiki Documentation

Create canonical, sourced reference pages for your story's characters, locations, events, and lore.

## Purpose

Build authoritative documentation that serves as "single source of truth" for your fictional world. These are polished, cited, encyclopedic reference pages suitable for readers - NOT working notes or brainstorming.

**Can be created before or during writing** for worldbuilding, lore, and reference material that won't all appear in the story itself.

## Wiki vs Brainstorm Notes

**The key distinction:** Wiki = you've decided and it's polished enough to show someone. Brainstorm = you're still figuring it out.

| Wiki | Brainstorm |
|------|------------|
| Single version | Multiple options coexist |
| Polished | Skeletal |
| No [TBD] markers | Source tags throughout |
| Reader-ready | Author's working notes |
| Finalized decisions | Exploratory |

## Core Principles

### 1. Canonical Only

Wiki pages contain ONLY confirmed information:
- Facts from written chapters OR finalized worldbuilding
- Details the author has decided
- Single authoritative version

### 2. Citations Required

Every claim needs a source:
- Chapter references for story facts
- "Worldbuilding document: [filename]" for lore created before writing
- Scene-specific citations when possible

### 3. Encyclopedic Tone

Write like a reference work:
- Third person
- Past tense for completed events, present for current state
- Neutral, factual tone

## Flexible Structure

**Wiki pages aren't templates to fill in** - structure should fit the content.

Some character pages need detailed backstory, others don't. Some locations are just "a tavern in the capital" - that's one paragraph, not 12 sections. Some magic systems need elaborate rules, others are intentionally mysterious.

**Include what matters, skip what doesn't.** Trust your judgment.

See references/page-patterns.md for common patterns and examples - not mandatory structures.

## Creating Wiki Pages

1. **Decide what needs documenting** - Character? Location? System? Event?
2. **Choose relevant structure** - See references/page-patterns.md for common patterns
3. **Write what matters** - Skip irrelevant sections, adapt structure to content
4. **Add citations** - See references/citation-guide.md for formats
5. **Cross-reference** - Link related pages for discoverability

Structure adapts to content - not every page needs every section.

## Using Web Search

Search when helpful for:
- Verifying real-world facts your story references
- Research for worldbuilding elements
- Finding similar fictional wikis for inspiration
- Checking naming conventions or terminology

## Timing

**You can write wiki pages BEFORE writing story chapters** - just ensure content is finalized and presentation-ready, not exploratory.

**For worldbuilding/lore:** Finalize concept → Create wiki page → Use while writing

**For story events:** Write chapters → Document what happened → Create wiki page

## Teaching Example: Simple vs Complex

**Not every page needs elaborate structure:**

**Simple location (totally valid):**
```markdown
---
title: The Broken Wheel Tavern
type: location
---

# The Broken Wheel Tavern

A run-down tavern in the merchant quarter of Kingsport. Known for cheap ale and cheaper rooms.

The protagonist meets their contact here in Chapter 3.

**References:**
- Chapter 3: First meeting scene
```

**Complex character (when needed):**
```markdown
---
title: Marcus Webb
type: character
status: alive
---

# Marcus Webb

Former military intelligence officer turned information broker in Kingsport.

## Background
Served 15 years in the Royal Intelligence Service before a scandal forced his resignation. Now operates independently, selling information to whoever can pay.

## Appearance
Mid-40s, graying hair, military bearing despite civilian clothes. Distinctive scar across left eyebrow from field injury.

## Role in Story
Acts as information source for the protagonist. Provides critical intelligence about the conspiracy in Chapter 3, then becomes recurring ally throughout Arc 1.

## Key Relationships
- **Sarah Chen**: Former colleague, maintains uneasy trust
- **The protagonist**: Professional relationship, provides information for payment

**References:**
- Chapter 3: First introduction, provides intel
- Chapter 7: Warns protagonist about surveillance  
- Chapter 12: Reveals his own involvement in the conspiracy
```

**Both are valid** - structure fits what needs documenting.

## Skills are Composable

Feel free to combine with other skills when helpful (e.g., using cw-brainstorm-capture while exploring worldbuilding before finalizing into wiki pages).

## File Placement (Claude Code)

1. Check project documentation for wiki organization
2. Common locations: `wiki/`, `docs/reference/`, `reference/`
3. Match existing naming conventions
4. Ask if unclear
