## Key Distinction: Brainstorm vs Documentation

This is the most common confusion:

**Still figuring it out?** → **cw-brainstorming**
- "Maybe X, or Y, or Z?"
- [TBD] markers everywhere
- Multiple versions coexist
- Skeletal notes

**You've decided and it's ready to show someone?** → **cw-official-docs**
- Single authoritative version
- Polished and reader-ready
- No [TBD] markers
- Canonical documentation

---

## Common Scenarios

### "I'm exploring worldbuilding ideas for my magic system"
→ **cw-brainstorming** (exploring, not finalized yet)

### "I've finalized my magic system and want to document it"
→ **cw-official-docs** (decided and ready to document)

### "I'm thinking through how this chapter should flow"
→ **cw-brainstorming** (planning/exploring)

### "I need to write this chapter"
→ **cw-prose-writing** (actually writing)

### "I wrote this chapter and want feedback"
→ **cw-story-critique** (getting feedback)

### "I need a character profile for my protagonist"
→ **cw-official-docs** if finalized, **cw-brainstorming** if still exploring

### "I'm figuring out character motivations and relationships"
→ **cw-brainstorming** (exploring)

### "I want to document this character's canon profile"
→ **cw-official-docs** (documenting finalized)

### "Help me work out the timeline of events"
→ **cw-brainstorming** (working through chronology)

### "I want Claude to write in my specific style"
→ **cw-style-skill-creator** first (create style skill), then **cw-prose-writing**

## Skills Work Together

You can use multiple skills in combination:

- **Brainstorm** → finalize → **Docs** (explore then document)
- **Brainstorm** → **Prose** (plan then write)
- **Prose** → **Critique** (write then get feedback)
- **Brainstorm** + **Docs** (check existing docs while brainstorming)
- **Critique** + **Brainstorm** (get feedback and brainstorm fixes)

Skills are composable - use whatever combination helps.

## Still Unsure?

**Default rules:**

1. **Exploring/uncertain?** → brainstorming
2. **Finalized/polished?** → official-docs
3. **Need feedback?** → story-critique
4. **Actually writing?** → prose-writing

When in doubt, start with brainstorming. You can always move to docs later when things are decided.
